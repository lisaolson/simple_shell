.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Hsh 
is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. 

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.RS 3
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the \fIenvironment\fR.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.RS 3
For the shell's purpose, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded. An exit status of zero indicates success. A non-zero exit status indicates failure.

The Shell builtin command \fBexit\fR returns a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero (false) if an error occurs while they execute.

.SH SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS

It does, however account for options and the two built-in commands listed above.
